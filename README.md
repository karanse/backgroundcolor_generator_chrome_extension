This project is based on one of the tutorials in [ZTM - Complete Web Developer](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/coding-bootcamp/) that I coded along with the video. During the course, I learnt how to create a page which generate linear gradient background colors based to 2 input colors chosen by the user. I took this functionality further to create a chrome extension so with it, we can easily pick the rgba or hex codes of 2 colors to create nicely contrasted background.
